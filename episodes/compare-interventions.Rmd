## Introduction

In this tutorial we will compare intervention scenarios against each other. To quantify the effect of the intervention we need to compare our intervention scenario to a counter factual (baseline) scenario. The *counter factual* here is the scenario in which nothing changes, often referred to as the 'do nothing' scenario. The counter factual scenario may feature no interventions at all or, if we are investigating the potential impact of an additional intervention in the later stages of an outbreak, there may be existing interventions in place. 

We must also decide what our *outcome of interest* is to make comparisons between intervention and counter factual scenarios. The outcome of interest can be:

+ a model outcome, e.g. number of infections or hospitalisations,
+ a metric such as the epidemic peak time or size,
+ a measure that uses the model outcomes, such as QALY/DALYs.

In this tutorial we are going to learn how to use the `{epidemics}` package to compare the effect of different interventions on simulated disease trajectories. We will access social contact data with `{socialmixr}`. We'll use `{dplyr}`, `{ggplot2}` and the pipe `%>%` to connect some of their functions, so let's also call to the `{tidyverse}` package:

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(epidemics)
library(socialmixr)
library(tidyverse)
```

In this tutorial we introduce the concept of the counter factual and how to compare scenarios (counter factual versus intervention) against each other. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Visualising the effect of interventions 

To compare the baseline scenario against the intervention scenarios, we can make visualisations of our outcome of interest. The outcome of interest may simply be the model output, or it could be an aggregate measure of the model output.

If we wanted to investigate the change in epidemic peak with an intervention applied, we could plot the model trajectories through time:
```{r}
output_baseline <- model_default(
  population = uk_population,
  transmission_rate = transmission_rate,
  infectiousness_rate = infectiousness_rate,
  recovery_rate = recovery_rate,
  time_end = 300, increment = 1.0
)

output_school <- model_default(
  # population
  population = uk_population,
  # rate
  transmission_rate = transmission_rate,
  infectiousness_rate = infectiousness_rate,
  recovery_rate = recovery_rate,
  # intervention
  intervention = list(contacts = close_schools),
  # time
  time_end = 300, increment = 1.0
)

# create intervention_type column for plotting
output_school$intervention_type <- "school closure"
output_baseline$intervention_type <- "baseline"
output <- rbind(output_school, output_baseline)

output %>%
  filter(compartment == "infectious") %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(
    x = time,
    y = value,
    color = intervention_type,
    linetype = intervention_type
  ) +
  stat_summary(
    fun = "sum",
    geom = "line",
    linewidth = 1
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::comma
  ) +
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = c(
      close_schools$time_begin,
      close_schools$time_end
    ),
    linetype = 2
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "Simulation time (days)",
    y = "Individuals"
  )
```

If we wanted to quantify the impact of the intervention over the model output through time, we could consider the cumulative number of infectious people in the baseline scenario compared to the intervention scenario: 

```{r}
output %>%
  filter(compartment == "infectious") %>%
  group_by(time, intervention_type) %>%
  summarise(value_total = sum(value)) %>%
  group_by(intervention_type) %>%
  mutate(cum_value = cumsum(value_total)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(
    aes(
      x = time,
      y = cum_value,
      color = intervention_type,
      linetype = intervention_type
    ),
    linewidth = 1.2
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::comma
  ) +
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = c(
      close_schools$time_begin,
      close_schools$time_end
    ),
    linetype = 2
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "Simulation time (days)",
    y = "Cumulative number of infectious individuals"
  )
```


### Vacamole model

The Vacamole model is a deterministic model based on a system of ODEs in [Ainslie et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.44.2101090) to describe the effect of vaccination on COVID-19 dynamics. The model consists of 11 compartments, individuals are classed as one of the following:

+ susceptible, $S$,
+ partial vaccination ($V_1$), fully vaccination ($V_2$),
+ exposed, $E$ and exposed while vaccinated, $E_V$,
+ infectious, $I$ and infectious while vaccinated, $I_V$,
+ hospitalised, $H$ and hospitalised while vaccinated, $H_V$,
+ dead, $D$,
+ recovered, $R$.

The diagram below describes the flow of individuals through the different compartments.

## Running a counterfactual scenario using the Vacamole model

1. Run the model with the default parameter values for the UK population assuming that :

+ 1 in a million individual are infectious (and not vaccinated) at the start of the simulation
+ The contact matrix for the United Kingdom has age bins:
  + age between 0 and 20 years,
  + age between 20 and 40,
  + 40 years and over.

For scenarios :
+ baseline : two dose vaccination program. Dose 1 (vaccination rate 0.01) starts from day 30, dose 2 (vaccination rate 0.01) starts from day 60. Both programs run fro 300 days. 
+ intervention :a mask mandate starting from time 60 for 100 days, assuming a reduction in the transmission rate of 0.163

There is no vaccination scheme in place

2. Using the output, plot the cumulative number of deaths through time

### HINT : Running the model with default parameter values

We can run the Vacamole model with [default parameter values](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epidemics/articles/model_vacamole.html#model-epidemic-using-vacamole) by just specifying the population object and number of time steps to run the model for:

  population = uk_population,
  time_end = 300
)

## Calculating outcomes averted

Visualisations are a useful tool to compare intervention scenario model predictions through time. In addition to visualisations, we also want to quantify the impact of interventions. An outcome of interest we can use is the number of infections averted. This measure allows us to quantify the difference between different intervention scenarios.

In `{epidemics}`, we can use the function `outcomes_averted()` to calculate the number of infections averted while accounting for uncertainty in key parameter values. We will extend the COVID-19 example in [Modelling interventions](../episodes/modelling-interventions.md) to account for some uncertainty in the parameter values, specifically in the basic reproduction $R_0$. We do this as follows: 

```{r}
# time periods
preinfectious_period <- 4.0
infectious_period <- 5.5

# specify the mean and standard deviation of R0
r_estimate_mean <- 2.7
r_estimate_sd <- 0.05

# generate 100 R samples
r_samples <- withr::with_seed(
  seed = 1,
  rnorm(
    n = 100, mean = r_estimate_mean, sd = r_estimate_sd
  )
)

beta <- r_samples / infectious_period

# rates
infectiousness_rate <- 1.0 / preinfectious_period
recovery_rate <- 1.0 / infectious_period
```

We use these parameter values alongside the population structure and contact matrix used in [Modelling interventions](../episodes/modelling-interventions.md) to run the model for the baseline scenario:

```{r}
output_baseline <- model_default(
  population = uk_population,
  transmission_rate = beta,
  infectiousness_rate = infectiousness_rate,
  recovery_rate = recovery_rate,
  time_end = 300, increment = 1.0
)
```


Then, we create a list of all the interventions we want to include in our comparison. We define our scenarios as follows:

+ scenario 1 : close schools
+ scenario 2 : mask mandate
+ scenario 3 : close schools and mask mandate.

In R we specify this as: 
```{r}
intervention_scenarios <- list(
  scenario_1 = list(
    contacts = close_schools
  ),
  scenario_2 = list(
    transmission_rate = mask_mandate
  ),
  scenario_3 = list(
    contacts = close_schools,
    transmission_rate = mask_mandate
  )
)
```

We use this list as our input to `intervention` in `model_default`

```{r}
output <- model_default(
  uk_population,
  transmission_rate = beta,
  infectiousness_rate = infectiousness_rate,
  recovery_rate = recovery_rate,
  time_end = 300, increment = 1.0,
  intervention = intervention_scenarios
)
head(output)
```

Now that we have our model output for all of our scenarios, we want to compare the outputs of the interventions to our baseline. 

We can do this using `outcomes_averted()` in `{epidemics}`. This function calculates the final epidemic size for each scenario, and then calculates the number of infections averted in each scenario compared to the baseline. To use this function we specify the :
  
+ output of the baseline scenario
+ outputs of the intervention scenario(s).

```{r}
intervention_effect <- outcomes_averted(
  baseline = output_baseline, scenarios = output
)
intervention_effect
```

The output gives us the infections averted in each scenario compared to the baseline. To obtain the infections averted overall we specify `by_group = FALSE`:

```{r}
intervention_effect <- outcomes_averted(
  baseline = output_baseline, scenarios = output,
  by_group = FALSE
)
intervention_effect
```

### Package vignettes

We recommend to read the vignette on [Modelling responses to a stochastic Ebola virus epidemic](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epidemics/articles/model_ebola.html) to use a discrete time, stochastic compartmental model of Ebola used during the 2014 West African EVD outbreak.

## Challenge : Ebola outbreak analysis

You have been tasked to investigate the potential impact of an intervention on an Ebola outbreak in Guinea (e.g. a reduction in risky contacts with cases). Using `model_ebola()` and the the information detailed below, find the number of infections averted when :

+ an intervention is applied to reduce the transmission rate by 50% from day 60 and,
+ an intervention is applied to reduce transmission by 10% from day 30.

For both interventions, we assume there is some uncertainty about the baseline transmission rate. We capture this uncertainty by drawing from a normal distribution with mean = 1.1 / 12 (i.e. $R_0=1.1$ and infectious period = 12 days) and  standard deviation = 0.01.

*Note: Depending on the number of replicates used, this simulation may take several minutes to run.*

+ Population size : 14 million
+ Initial number of exposed individuals : 10
+ Initial number of infectious individuals : 5
+ Time of simulation : 120 days
+ Parameter values : 
  + $R_0$ (`r0`) = 1.1,
  + $p^I$ (`infectious_period`) = 12,
  + $p^E$ (`preinfectious_period`) = 5,
  + $k^E=k^I = 2$, 
  + $1-p_{hosp}$ (`prop_community`) = 0.9,
  + $p_{ETU}$ (`etu_risk`) = 0.7,

  intervention = intervention_scenarios
)

# calculate outcomes averted
intervention_effect <- outcomes_averted(
  baseline = output_baseline, scenarios = output_intervention,
  by_group = FALSE

**Note: The number of infections averted can be negative. This is due to the stochastic variation in the disease trajectories for a given transmission rate can result in a different size outbreak.**
