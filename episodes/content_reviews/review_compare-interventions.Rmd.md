Here is a summary list of required changes based on the provided .Rmd teaching content:

### Typos and Grammatical Errors
- **"counter factual"** should be consistently written as **"counterfactual"** throughout the document.
- In the sentence "the scenario in which nothing changes, often referred to as the 'do nothing' scenario," consider changing **"do nothing"** to **"do-nothing"** for consistency with hyphenation.
- In the phrase **"both programs run fro 300 days,"** correct **"fro"** to **"for."**
- In the section **"mask mandate,"** the name should be capitalized as **"Mask Mandate"** for consistency with other intervention names.

### Ambiguous Statements or Unclear Explanations
- The term **"outcome of interest"** could be better defined or exemplified earlier in the document to clarify its significance.
- The phrase **"the outcome of interest may simply be the model output"** could be misleading; clarify that the model output is a type of outcome but not the only one.
- In the **"Vacamole model"** section, clarify what **"ODEs"** stands for (Ordinary Differential Equations) for readers who may not be familiar with the term.

### Technical Inconsistencies
- In the **"initial_conditions_vacamole"** section, the variable **"EV"** should be consistently written as **"E_V"** to match the notation used in the model description.
- The **"age bins"** in the challenge section should be clearly defined to match the age limits used in the contact matrix (0-20, 20-40, 40+).
- In the **"Calculating outcomes averted"** section, ensure that the function **`outcomes_averted()`** is properly explained, including its input requirements and expected output.

### Epidemiological Inaccuracies or Imprecision
- The statement **"1 in a million individual are infectious"** should specify whether this is a proportion of the total population or a fixed number for clarity.
- The **"mask mandate"** intervention description should clarify whether the reduction in transmission rate is based on empirical data or theoretical assumptions.
- In the **"Ebola outbreak analysis"** challenge, clarify the implications of a negative number of infections averted, as this could confuse learners regarding the interpretation of stochastic models.

### Additional Suggestions
- Consider adding a **"References"** section at the end to cite the sources mentioned (e.g., Ainslie et al. 2022) for better academic rigor.
- Ensure that all code snippets are properly formatted and tested to avoid runtime errors during the teaching session.
- Include a brief **"Conclusion"** section summarizing the key takeaways from the tutorial to reinforce learning objectives.
