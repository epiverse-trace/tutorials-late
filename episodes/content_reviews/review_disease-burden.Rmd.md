Here is a summary list of required changes based on the provided .Rmd teaching content:

### Typos and Grammatical Errors
- **"wrods"** should be corrected to **"words"** in the sentence: "In other wrods, we can first run an epidemic model..."
- **"cumulative sumo"** should be corrected to **"cumulative sum"** in the sentence: "The difference between these two quantities gives is the current number of people in hospital."

### Ambiguous Statements or Unclear Explanations
- The phrase **"we can separate out models of transmission from models of burden"** could be clarified. It may be beneficial to explain what is meant by "separate out" in this context.
- The term **"tail of the distribution"** could be more explicitly defined, as it may not be clear to all learners what this entails in terms of statistical distributions.
- The explanation of **"convolution"** could be simplified or expanded with a more intuitive example to ensure understanding, especially for learners unfamiliar with the concept.

### Technical Inconsistencies
- In the section discussing the **infection-hospitalisation ratio (IHR)**, it would be helpful to clarify how the value of **0.1** was determined or provide a reference for this figure.
- The use of **"density()"** in the context of calculating hospitalisations and discharges may need clarification, as it is not immediately clear how this function is being applied to the distributions defined earlier.

### Epidemiological Inaccuracies or Imprecision
- The tutorial mentions using a **Gamma distribution** for the time from infection to admission and from admission to discharge. It would be beneficial to provide justification for choosing this distribution over others, as well as any assumptions made regarding the underlying data.
- The tutorial states that **"hospitalised cases contribute to new infections"** for diseases like Ebola. This statement may need further context or clarification, as it could be misleading without explaining the specific transmission dynamics of Ebola compared to other diseases.

### Additional Suggestions
- Consider adding a brief introduction or overview of the **epidemiological concepts** being discussed, especially for learners who may not have a strong background in the subject.
- Ensure that all code snippets are accompanied by comments explaining their purpose, as this will aid learners in understanding the practical applications of the concepts discussed.
- It may be helpful to include references or further reading materials for learners who wish to delve deeper into the topics covered in the tutorial.
