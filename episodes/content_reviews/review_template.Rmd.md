Here is a summary list of required changes based on the provided .Rmd teaching content:

### Typos or Grammatical Errors
- **Title Formatting**: The title 'Lesson title' should be more descriptive or specific to the lesson content.
- **Inconsistent Punctuation**: In the "Challenge 1" and "Challenge 2" sections, there is inconsistent use of colons and spacing. For example, "## Challenge 1 : can the learner run existing code" should be "## Challenge 1: Can the learner run existing code".
- **Capitalization**: In "Challenge 2 : edit code/answer a question", "edit" should be capitalized to maintain consistency with the previous challenge title.

### Ambiguous Statements or Unclear Explanations
- **Introductory Text**: The placeholder "Introductory text" should be replaced with actual content that clearly outlines the purpose and scope of the lesson.
- **Keypoints Section**: The instruction "Summarise the key points of the lesson using bullet points" is vague. It would be more helpful to provide an example or specify what types of key points should be included.

### Technical Inconsistencies
- **Age Limits in Challenges**: In "Challenge 1", the age limits are defined as `c(0, 20, 40)`, while in "Challenge 2", they are `c(0, 15, 50)`. Ensure that the age limits are consistent with the context of the lesson and clarify the rationale behind the chosen age bins.
- **Code Duplication**: The code in the "Challenge 1" and "Solution" sections is identical. It may be beneficial to clarify that learners should modify the code in the challenge section and provide a different solution in the solution section.

### Epidemiological Inaccuracies or Imprecision
- **Country-Specific Data**: Ensure that the contact data being used from `socialmixr::polymod` is up-to-date and relevant for the specified countries (United Kingdom and Poland). If there are any known limitations or considerations regarding the data, they should be mentioned.
- **Age Bins Explanation**: The age bins used in the challenges should be explained in terms of their relevance to epidemiological studies or contact patterns. This will help learners understand the importance of these choices.

### Additional Suggestions
- **Hyperlinking Prerequisites**: Ensure that the lessons/packages listed in the "prereq" section are properly hyperlinked to their respective resources for easy access.
- **Instructor Notes**: The instructor notes section could benefit from more specific guidance on timing challenges and how to address them during the lesson.

By addressing these points, the clarity and effectiveness of the teaching content can be significantly improved.
