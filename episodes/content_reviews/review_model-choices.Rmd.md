Here is a summary list of required changes based on the provided .Rmd teaching content:

### Typos and Grammatical Errors
- **"its often appropriate"** should be corrected to **"it's often appropriate"** (contraction of "it is").
- **"the the information"** in the "Running the model" section should be corrected to **"the information"** (remove the duplicate "the").
- **"through time"** is used multiple times; consider using **"over time"** for consistency and clarity.

### Ambiguous Statements or Unclear Explanations
- **"A model may already exist for your study disease, or there may be a model for an infection that has the same transmission pathways and epidemiological features that can be used."** This statement could be clearer. Consider rephrasing to specify what "the same transmission pathways and epidemiological features" means in practical terms.
- **"Model structures differ for whether the disease has pandemic potential or not."** This could be clarified. It may be beneficial to explain what is meant by "pandemic potential" and how it affects model choice.
- **"The outcome of interest can be a feature of a mathematical model."** This statement is vague. It would be clearer to specify that the outcome of interest is typically a measurable quantity derived from the model.

### Technical Inconsistencies
- In the **"What is the outcome of interest?"** section, it mentions "simulating the numbers of infection through time." It would be more precise to say "simulating the number of infections over time" to maintain grammatical consistency.
- In the **"Will any interventions be modelled?"** section, it states that a model may or may not have the capability to include interventions. It would be helpful to provide examples of common interventions that can be modeled.

### Epidemiological Inaccuracies or Imprecision
- The explanation of **deterministic vs. stochastic models** could be misleading. It states that "epidemics are larger in magnitude than outbreaks," which may not always be true. Clarify that outbreaks can be considered as localized epidemics and that the terms can sometimes be used interchangeably depending on context.
- The description of the **SEIHFR model** should clarify that the "Hospitalised" and "Funeral" compartments are critical for understanding Ebola transmission dynamics, as they are unique to this disease. This could help learners understand the importance of these compartments in the context of Ebola specifically.

### Additional Suggestions
- Consider adding a brief **glossary** or **definitions** section for terms like "stochastic," "deterministic," "transmissibility," and "epidemic" to aid learners who may not be familiar with these concepts.
- Ensure that all links (e.g., to tutorials and references) are functional and lead to the correct resources, as broken links can hinder learning.
- It may be beneficial to include a **summary or conclusion** section at the end of the tutorial to reinforce key points and learning objectives.

By addressing these points, the clarity, accuracy, and overall quality of the teaching content can be significantly improved.
